# PythonAI-BitDegree
Course project associated with BitDegree course: Python Image Recognition: Hands-On Artificial Intelligence Course.
The project contains all the practices given in the course as well as some document summaries that highlights the main points.
The project gives a brief introduction for Python, then another brief introduction for TensorFlow.
The aims of the project is to train a simple neural network image recognition model that uses CIFAR dataset with 10 objects to be recognized.

# Highlights and Summary From the Course
I summarized most of the important point throughout the course in the repository's wiki pages: [PythonAI-BitDegree's Wiki](https://github.com/shefaas/PythonAI-BitDegree/wiki)

# Recognition Model
The model can recognize 10 object types as listed: [airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck]. The model has accuracy of %62 where the training steps repeated only 10 times. The three images of the cat, car, and frog were used for prediction. Two out of the three images got correct prediction.
