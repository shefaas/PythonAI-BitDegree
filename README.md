# PythonAI-BitDegree
Course project associated with BitDegree course: Python Image Recognition: Hands-On Artificial Intelligence Course.
The project contains all the practices given in the course as well as some document summaries that highlights the main points.
The project gives a brief introduction for Python, then another brief introduction for TensorFlow.
The aims of the project is to train a simple neural network image recognition model that uses CIFAR dataset with 10 objects to be recognized.
